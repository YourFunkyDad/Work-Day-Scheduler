# Work-Day-Scheduler

Having recently completed the Code Quiz for Module 4, completing this Module 5 challenge did not prove to be as headache-inducing as some other challenges. 

I am still not very comfortable with JQuery. I do understand that it is essentially a cleaner, simpler way to condense your JavaScript.

Having used many references from the internet and essentially triple checking every function along the way, I still have a far ways to go when it comes to getting comfortable writing JQuery. 

My local storage is caching the text information I input, but it is not saving the exact value. (See Screenshot Below)

The application is roughly more than ~80% complete, but there are a few things I would like to add, like the ability to drag and drop the text boxes into the other timeblocks.
